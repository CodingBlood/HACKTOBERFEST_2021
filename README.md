## :octocat: What is Hacktoberfest?
A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and GitHub to get people involved in Open Source. Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community.
[https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
Use this project to make your first contribution to an open source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some simple tasks in this project.

## :warning: Disclaimer:
This repo is to welcome beginners to Github and the opensource community by helping them learn how to make their first PR and contributions to open source!
That said, only high-quality contributions and pull requests that add value to Open Source projects are part of the the [core values](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) of Hacktoberfest, so repositories like this one and others which allow users to quickly gain a PR toward completing the challenge might be excluded from the Hacktoberfest.
So we highly recommend you to contribute in a meaningful way to other [Hacktoberfest issues](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#projects) and not rely on this repository alone.
